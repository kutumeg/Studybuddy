### Project Description
[StudyBuddy is a study tracking web app that lets users log sessions, visualize progress with charts, and compare study time with friends. It includes mood tracking, a leaderboard, and a weekly recap to enhance learning productivity.]

### The Problem statement
[Helping students realize they spent more time generating fancy study reports than actually studying]

### The Solution
[By turning study tracking into a game‚Äîbecause nothing says "I‚Äôm productive" like a leaderboard, colorful charts, and a friendly competition to see who procrastinates the least]

[This code creates a Study Tracking Web App where users can log their study sessions, track progress, and compare with friends. It features a form where users enter the subject, duration, date, and mood for each session, storing the data in localStorage. A report section visualizes study patterns using Chart.js, displaying a doughnut chart for study subjects and a line chart for daily study hours. Users can also generate a study buddy link to share with friends, although it currently doesn‚Äôt sync data between users. The app provides a leaderboard, tracking total study hours, and enhances user experience with a clean, responsive UI.]
